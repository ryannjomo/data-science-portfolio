# Data Science Portfolio – PGP-DSBA Projects

This repository contains a collection of hands-on projects I completed as part of the Postgraduate Program in Data Science and Business Analytics (PGP-DSBA), offered by the McCombs School of Business. While the project themes were guided by the curriculum, all the analysis, coding, and interpretation in the notebooks reflect my own work and understanding.

The projects cover a wide range of data science techniques, including data wrangling, visualization, classification, regression, forecasting, and model evaluation. Together, they reflect my learning journey and growing proficiency with tools like Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.
